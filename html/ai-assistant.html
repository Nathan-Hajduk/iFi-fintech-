                        <strong>How much money do I need to start investing?</strong>
                        <p>You can start with as little as $50-$100. Many brokers now offer fractional shares, allowing you to invest in expensive stocks with small amounts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>What's the difference between investing and trading?</strong>
                        <p>Investing is long-term wealth building (years), while trading involves frequent buying/selling for short-term gains. Investing is generally safer for beginners.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>How do I choose my first investment?</strong>
                        <p>Start with broad-market index funds or ETFs like S&P 500. They provide instant diversification and lower risk than individual stocks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>What's dollar-cost averaging?</strong>
                        <p>Investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., $200/month) regardless of market conditions. This reduces timing risk and builds wealth systematically.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>Should I pay off debt before investing?</strong>
                        <p>Pay off high-interest debt (>7-8%) first. For lower-interest debt, you can often invest and pay debt simultaneously for better overall returns.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>What's a diversified portfolio?</strong>
                        <p>Spreading investments across different assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to reduce risk. Don't put all eggs in one basket.</p>

                        <strong>What exactly is a stock?</strong>
                        <p>A stock represents partial ownership in a company. When you buy shares, you own a piece of that business and can profit from its growth.</p>

                        <strong>How do I research a stock before buying?</strong>
                        <p>Look at P/E ratio, revenue growth, profit margins, debt levels, and competitive advantages. Read earnings reports and industry news.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>Growth stocks vs. value stocks?</strong>
                        <p>Growth stocks have high potential but higher risk (tech startups). Value stocks are established companies trading below their intrinsic value.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>When should I sell a stock?</strong>
                        <p>When fundamentals change (poor earnings, management issues), if you need to rebalance, or if better opportunities emerge. Don't panic-sell during dips.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">

                        <p>Bonds are loans you give to governments or corporations. They pay you interest regularly and return your principal at maturity. Lower risk than stocks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>Government bonds vs. corporate bonds?</strong>
                        <p>Government bonds (Treasury) are safest but lower returns. Corporate bonds pay more but have higher default risk. Rating agencies assess credit quality.</p>

                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>Why invest in bonds?</strong>
                        <p>Bonds provide stable income, reduce portfolio volatility, and preserve capital. Essential for diversification and risk management, especially near retirement.</p>

                    <div class="question-item">

                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>How do interest rates affect bonds?</strong>
                        <p>When rates rise, existing bond prices fall (and vice versa). If you hold until maturity, rate changes don't affect your return.</p>

                        <strong>Should I invest in real estate?</strong>
                        <p>Real estate provides rental income, tax benefits, and appreciation potential. Requires more capital and effort than stocks but can diversify portfolio.</p>

                    <div class="question-item">
                        <strong>What are REITs?</strong>
                        <p>Real Estate Investment Trusts—companies that own/operate income-producing properties. Invest in real estate without buying property directly.</p>

                        <strong>Real estate vs. stock market?</strong>
                        <p>Real estate: tangible, leverage via mortgages, tax benefits. Stocks: more liquid, easier diversification, lower entry cost. Both have merit.</p>
